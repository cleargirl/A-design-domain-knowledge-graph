The ontology of the dKG is organized into three hierarchical levels: system-level, component-level, and part-level entities. This hierarchy is inferred from the positional roles of entities along knowledge chains in the graph rather than being manually predefined. Entities located at upstream positions of the chains are regarded as system-level entities (e.g., sewage treatment systems), midstream entities correspond to functional components (e.g., filtration units, biological reactors), and downstream entities represent concrete parts or materials (e.g., inlet ports, outlet ports).
